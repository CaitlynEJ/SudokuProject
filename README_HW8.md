A playable Sudoku Game


This game has a hard coded board instance where some numbers are given to you.
To run this program, use the command: 'python3 sudoku.py'
The program includes a main() function that allows it to be run as a script.

The program will begin by giving you a breif set of instructions. You will then
be asked to input 'yes' if you are ready. If you hit enter, or type something else,
the game will exit. So please be careful.

Once you begin, you will be asked to insert a Column value, a row value, and a number.
Again, be careful about accidently hitting enter, or not putting in a valid value.
I have tried to check for non letters, or numbers, but I will not likely catch everything.

Once you have completely filled in the board with your input, the program will automatically
check your input is a correct solution, or if it is incorrect. Unfortunely, it will
not tell you where the error has occurred. Only if the inputted solution is correct or not.

For your convenience, the solution to the puzzle is below:
